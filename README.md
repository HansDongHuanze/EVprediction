## Data Description

The data used in this study is drawn from a publicly available mobile application, which provides the real-time availability of charging piles (i.e., idle or not). Within Shenzhen, China, a total of 18,061 public charging piles are covered during the studied period from 19 June to 18 July 2022 (30 days) with a minimum interval of 5 minutes and `8640 timestamps`. As shown in Figure 1, the city is constructed into a graph-structure data with `247 nodes` (traffic zones) and `1006 edges` (adjacent relationships).

Besides, the pricing schemes for the studied charging piles are also collected. Among the 247 traffic zones, 57 of them (enclosed in red lines) deploy time-based pricing schemes, while others use fixed ones. More statistical details are illustrated in the following table.

## Files
* `adj.csv`: The adjacent matrix of studied areas, 1 indicates the two traffic zones are neighboring, vice versa.
* `distance.csv`: Distances between nodes.
* `information.csv`: Several basis information about the data, including pile capacity, longitude, latitude, whether or not located in the central business district (1:yes, 0:no), and whether or not on a time-based pricing scheme (1:yes, 0:no).
* `occupancy.csv`: The real-time EV charging occupancy in studied areas.
* `duration.csv`: The real-time EV charging duration in studied areas, i.e., the sum of charging time for all charging piles, unit in hour.
* `volume.csv`: The real-time EV charging volume in studied areas, i.e., the total power consumption of all charging piles, unit in kWh.
* `price.csv`: The real-time EV charging pricing in studied areas.
* `time.csv`: The timestamps of studied period.
* `Shenzhen.qgz`: The QGIS map file of Shenzhen city.

## An simple example to run Spatio-temporal Prediction on the dataset

We developed a physics-informed and attention-based approach for spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction, named **PAG**. Expect that, some representative methods are included, e.g., LSTM, and GCN-LSTM, GAT-LSTM. You can train and test the proposed model through the following procedures:

1. Choose your model in line 45 of `main.py` or use the default model (PAG-) by skipping this procedure.
2. Run `main.py` via Pycharm, etc. or change your ROOT_PATH and command:

```shell
cd [path] && python main.py
```

## Extend:
* If you want to run your own models on the datasets we offer, you should go to `models.py` and replace the model in `main.py`.


More updates will be posed in the near future! Thank you for your interest.
